# What is a PWA?

*//How many familiar with PWAs?*

TLDWNR: *//too long will not read*

* A progressive Web App is a web app that has been enhanced to improve user experiences
*based on the app's context*.

*Mr speaker, Could you say that again but like make it longer?*

Sure,

* A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.
These apps meet certain requirements (to be discussed), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.
